<h3>This map shows the total number of greenhouse gas emissions by state in 2018. Greenhouse gases are a series of gases - emitted predominantly as a result of human activity - that have been linked to global warming. Because the United States gives certain powers to states, local governments have some jurisdiction over the GHG emissions of their state and their contribution to the current climate crisis.  </h3>
